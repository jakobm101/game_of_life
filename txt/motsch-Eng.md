Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Design and Computation Master Program, as I believe it is the perfect fit for my academic and professional goals. My goal is to explore how technologies like IoT, Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Interactive Spaces shape society presently and in the future in a playful, critical, and creative way. My ultimate goal is to use this knowledge to emphasize the urgency of addressing the climate crisis. I plan to combine my skills in design, computer science, and knowledge transfer to achieve this, which aligns with the goals of the Design and Computation Master Program.

During my Bachelor's degree in Communication Design at the University of Applied Sciences, I gained valuable insights into information transfer, which has further sparked my interest in game design, interaction design, branding, and typography. Game design, in particular, fascinates me because of its potential to create immersive and interactive experiences that motivate people intrinsically. Additionally, as a new cultural medium, games offer remarkable narratives, despite the fact that some stories are considered less elegant and inferior to literary masterpieces.

My expertise in game design and my interdisciplinary background make me an excellent candidate for the Design and Computation Master Program. Game design is highly relevant to the program as it involves the creative use of technology to create immersive and interactive experiences. Furthermore, game design involves the design of complex systems, from game mechanics to narrative structures, which directly applies to the program's emphasis on the design of complex, interactive systems. Lastly, game design is a highly interdisciplinary field that draws on a variety of disciplines, including art, psychology, and computer science, which aligns with the Design and Computation Master Program's interdisciplinary approach.

Furthermore, my Bachelor's degree has equipped me with knowledge and skills in advertising and branding, which are essential components of the Design and Computation Master Program. I have developed a critical understanding of advertising methods and how they influence people's consumption behavior. Moreover, my studies have taught me how to analyze different social classes and their styles to differentiate and maintain a sense of shared exclusivity. These analyses have enabled me to identify my target audience and optimize my communication strategies accordingly.

Lastly, my studies in interaction design have enabled me to understand the psychological factors that influence people's behavior towards digital platforms. I have learned that user experience (UX) is a fundamental component in designing the settings and behavior of people towards digital platforms. A positive UX leads to higher engagement, while a negative UX can cause frustration and disinterest. As digital platforms become increasingly important in modern society, it is essential to consider the importance of UX in designing digital platforms.

Overall, I believe that my academic background and professional experience make me a strong candidate for the Design and Computation Master Program. I am confident that the program will provide me with the necessary knowledge and skills to achieve my career goals while contributing to the program's collaborative and interdisciplinary environment.

As an inquisitive mind, I seek to explore the playful, critical, and creative implications of emergent technologies such as the Internet of Things, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and interactive spaces. My purpose in doing so is to gain insight into how these technological advancements are currently and prospectively shaping society. My overarching aim is to employ this knowledge to highlight the pressing urgency of addressing the climate crisis. To achieve this, I endeavor to synthesize my aptitudes in design, computer science, and knowledge dissemination, all of which are facilitated by the Design and Computation degree program.

It is important for me to understand how people are encouraged to consume. Furthermore, delving into the various social strata comprising our society, as well as the manner in which said groups seek to differentiate themselves through distinct styles and cultivate a sense of shared exclusivity, is of equal significance. Such analyses afford me the ability to discern the target demographic to whom I intend to direct my message, as well as to optimize my communication strategy accordingly. This, in turn, allows me to evade the potential pitfall of disseminating my message solely to individuals who are already in agreement with my views, but rather to extend it to those who are still in the process of forming their opinions or are indeed convinced of a contrary stance.
