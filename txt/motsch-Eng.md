As an inquisitive mind, I seek to explore the playful, critical, and creative implications of emergent technologies such as the Internet of Things, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and interactive spaces. My purpose in doing so is to gain insight into how these technological advancements are currently and prospectively shaping society. My overarching aim is to employ this knowledge to highlight the pressing urgency of addressing the climate crisis. To achieve this, I endeavor to synthesize my aptitudes in design, computer science, and knowledge dissemination, all of which are facilitated by the Design and Computation degree program.

It is important for me to understand how people are encouraged to consume. Furthermore, delving into the various social strata comprising our society, as well as the manner in which said groups seek to differentiate themselves through distinct styles and cultivate a sense of shared exclusivity, is of equal significance. Such analyses afford me the ability to discern the target demographic to whom I intend to direct my message, as well as to optimize my communication strategy accordingly. This, in turn, allows me to evade the potential pitfall of disseminating my message solely to individuals who are already in agreement with my views, but rather to extend it to those who are still in the process of forming their opinions or are indeed convinced of a contrary stance.
