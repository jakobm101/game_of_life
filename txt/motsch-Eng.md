As an inquisitive mind, I seek to explore the playful, critical, and creative implications of emergent technologies such as the Internet of Things, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and interactive spaces. My purpose in doing so is to gain insight into how these technological advancements are currently and prospectively shaping society. My overarching aim is to employ this knowledge to highlight the pressing urgency of addressing the climate crisis. To achieve this, I endeavor to synthesize my aptitudes in design, computer science, and knowledge dissemination, all of which are facilitated by the Design and Computation degree program.
